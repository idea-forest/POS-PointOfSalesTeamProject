--One of the biggest challanges for me was to implement the register/payement view. I had to handle the button clicks with MVVM binding. Although I was scared at the beginning, after all i found that the solution MVVM offers was very elegant. I din't need to name my ui controls, and I used a single command to handle all the buttons.

Although I was scared at the beginning, after all i found that the solution MVVM offers was very elegant. I din't need to name my ui controls, and I used a single command to handle all the buttons. I had to bind my buttons to commands that would know the content of the button was clicked and add the number to the Amount textbox. We also had to make validation to make sure the fot cannot be pressed at the beginning and it can be pressed only once, to receve the loo of a calculator with decimal points.
 
 
--I really wanted to achieve the effect of a pressed button. It was not easy to find a solution.Finally the triggers provided the functionality we needed. We bound the style of the button to a boolean property in our Viewmodel, wich would make the button disabled when it's pressed So We could use one the triggers porperty - mouse disabled

-- We have a form to add and update products. There we must bind the selected item in one combobox to what another combobox shous as a selected Item. We  used lambda expressions to achieve that.

We check if the second combo box has the id of the item selected in the second combo box, id it finds it it shows it.
 
 
 6. To be honest we implemented pretty much all we planned in our project proposal. But to be continued, We think we could provide additional modules, such as giving to the customer an interface to make orders and not stay in line, as we see now more and more in fast-food stores. Also we could provide managers with new functionalities, such as viewing inventory, vendors and complex reports
